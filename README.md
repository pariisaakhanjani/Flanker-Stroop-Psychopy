# Flanker-Stroop Experiment with Psychopy

This is a simple Flanker-Stroop experiment, which I have coded as a project for the course **"Building an Experiment in Python"**.
For this project I have used *"Psychopy"* which is an open-source Python package.

First, the experimenter should enter the participant's ID and choose the project.
