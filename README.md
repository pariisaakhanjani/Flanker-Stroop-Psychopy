# Flanker-Stroop Experiment with PsychoPy

This is a simple Flanker-Stroop experiment, which I have coded as a project for the course **"Building an Experiment in Python"**.  
For this project, I have used *"PsychoPy"*, which is an open-source Python package.

### Overview
First, the experimenter should enter the participant's ID and choose the project:

### Flanker Part
In the Flanker part of the experiment, participants are shown a series of trials. For example:

![Flanker Example 2](Images/Flanker2.png)

After completing the Flanker block, the participant receives a message that the next block is starting:

### Stroop Part
In the Stroop part of the experiment, participants are shown tasks involving color-word conflict. For example:
